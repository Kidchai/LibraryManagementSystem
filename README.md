Project for book management at library. Web-application for librarians.

This is the first part of my implementation of this management system with the same functionality but different libraries.

[Library1]() stack: Java, Spring MVC, JDBC, PostgreSQL, Thymeleaf, HTML

- Create, delete, and edit book records
- Register new people as customers
- Edit information about customers, and delete customers' profiles
- Borrow books to customers
- Mark returned books as available

### How does it work?
