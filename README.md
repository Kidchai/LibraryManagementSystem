## Web-application for librarians to book management tasks

### What is it?
This is a web-application designed to simplify the book management tasks of librarians. It provides an easy-to-use interface for managing book records and customer profiles.

### What does this version do?
Built with Spring MVC, Hibernate, and Spring Data JPA, this version of application utilizes PostgreSQL to store book and customer records, and Thymeleaf as a template engine for a user interface.

This system streamlines a variety of librarian tasks, including creating, editing, and deleting book records, registering new customers, modifying customer information, and removing customer profiles. Additionally, librarians can lend books to customers and track the return of books.

### What's new in this version?

This version includes some new features that I believe will make managing libraries more efficient, such as:

- The ability to search for books by title.
- The option to sort books by year of publication.
- Automatic tracking of borrowed books, with a 30-day return policy.
- Overdue books are highlighted in red in the customer's lists.
